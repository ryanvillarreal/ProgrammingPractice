# Programming Practice
==============

Come look at my PP... repo :| (phrasing)


### What it do
I needed to organize my GitHub a bit, and felt a centralized programming folder would be best.  I can put all 
of my failed projects and one-off scripts that get uploaded and then forgotten.  

### Why would you do that?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

idk. Submit a pull request and show me how to do it better.  We are all here for learning.
