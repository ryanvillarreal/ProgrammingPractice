### Automated Wireless Pentesting Tool

AngryWiFi is a proof of concept for automated wireless penetration testing tool.  The hope is to be able to automate the process of scanning and collecting PreShared Keys from WPA/WPA2 wireless networks.  

Currently the package relies upon the PyRic package which is only usable from Linux distros.  Therefore, the majority of development and testing is being performed on a out of the box Kali Linux rolling release.
